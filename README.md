## Development

This is a learning project focused on fundamental web development concepts. The application is built using basic web technologies to maintain simplicity and focus on core functionality.

## Ingredient Import Tool

- Open `ingredients.html` and choose **Import From URL** to launch the scraper.
- Paste the link to a recipe or product page that exposes structured data (Recipe or Product schema) and the tool will pull available ingredients and nutrition.
- Review the fetched details, then choose **Prefill Ingredient Form** to copy the data into the custom ingredient form before saving.
- Some sites block cross-origin requests; if fetching fails, try a different URL or manually enter the ingredient details instead.
